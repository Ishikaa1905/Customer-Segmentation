Customer Segmentation Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using data analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. These insights help businesses improve marketing strategies, personalization, and customer retention.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains customer-related information (such as purchase amounts, frequency, and demographics).
Key features typically include:

Customer ID

Age / Gender / Income

Purchase frequency / Recency

Spending patterns

(Adjust according to your dataset columns if needed.)

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy â†’ Data cleaning & manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn â†’ Data visualization

scikit-learn â†’ Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical, etc.)

scipy â†’ Additional analysis

ðŸš€ Approach

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Standardizing/normalizing features

Feature engineering (e.g., RFM metrics â€“ Recency, Frequency, Monetary value)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing customer demographics

Identifying spending distributions & outliers

Correlation analysis

Customer Segmentation

Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)

Finding the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score)

Labeling customer groups based on characteristics

Insights & Business Value

Segment profiling (e.g., High-value customers, Budget customers, Occasional shoppers)

Actionable recommendations for marketing strategies

ðŸ“ˆ Results

Customers are segmented into distinct clusters.

Visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps) show clear differences between groups.

The analysis helps businesses target the right audience with personalized campaigns.
